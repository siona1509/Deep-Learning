# Image Reconstruction using Customized Autoencoder Model



## Problem Statement

• Addressed the challenge of image reconstruction in multimode fibre imaging systems, where complex speckle patterns are generated
• Curated a dataset of 5000 MNIST images to optimize model training and evaluation 
• Developed and implemented a high-accuracy autoencoder-based deep learning model achieving 92.7% precision in reconstructing images from complex speckle patterns in multimode fiber imaging systems.
